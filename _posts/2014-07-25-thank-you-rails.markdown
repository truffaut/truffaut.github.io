# Thank you Rails!

Today [celebrates the 10th year anniversary of the Ruby on Rails framework](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/98cb3e69afd687f7c0d4bc48eabf284da691abcc#commitcomment-4974690). I remember first hearing about Rails in high school (so... probably late 2004/early 2005) in discussions on Slashdot but not having any real idea what it did. Fast-forward past some *"distractions"* in university to 2010 and I would be using Rails to (poorly) create applications. I can say with confidence that **I owe my current success as a developer to Ruby on Rails and the community that built up around it**.

Before using Rails, I built many sites using software like Wordpress or by attempting to build my own one-off client-side solutions in a bastardization of JavaScript. These I like to refer to as my Dark Ages. Corresponding to this moniker, I've done my best to forget as much about my software development practices (or the lack thereof) during this time.

The first gigs that I started getting that were able to pull me completely out of IT support and into full-time software development were Rails-based. At the time, I have to admit I didn't fully know what I was getting into. I knew that I could build web applications, I knew that I was learning quickly, and I knew that I could (usually) fulfill my client's requirements. As I spent more and more time coding every day, eventually with more-experienced developers, I felt my knowledge multiplying daily. I started giving most of my energy to something that has become the over-arching focus of my life: solving problems.

These days I don't really use Rails all that much: I don't really like the ActiveRecord pattern, debugging Rails applications can be extraordinarily tedious amongst other things. I even find myself usually reaching for languages other than Ruby for my personal projects, though I do still teach a predominantly Ruby-based curriculum at [MakersSquare](http://www.makersquare.com).

Even at MakerSquare, we spend *much* less time learning the particulars of the framework than we once did. Over time, we came to the realization that Rails solves a lot of the problems that web developers consistently encountered before something like Rails existed. But, for complete newcomers to programming, solutions to unknown problems make little sense, and it seems like a lot of arbitrary rituals to go through to start a basic app. [As Steve Klabnik quoted in this blog post](http://words.steveklabnik.com/rails-has-two-default-stacks), "Starting Rails today is like starting to watch a soap opera in the 7th season." Even worse, many of the skills and techniques learned building Rails applications end up being proprietary to Rails and are antithetical to our goal of teaching transferrable skills that enable our graduates to begin a *career* in development, not just get a job in development.

At the end of the day, even if the novelty of Rails has worn off, I'm still incredibly thankful for what I've gained from the release of the framework. For an unsure nerd who desperately wanted to program but didn't want to be Dilbert, hating code in my cube, Rails seemed like the answer. Sure, maybe I could have had the same progress I had hit my stride programming with CakePHP or Wordpress, but for me, Rails was my first deep-dive and for all I know, all the fortune I've had come my way since those days may never have happened had I not cracked open the Rails guides with my trusty copy of the Pickaxe and dug in a few years ago.

Happy Birthday Rails!
