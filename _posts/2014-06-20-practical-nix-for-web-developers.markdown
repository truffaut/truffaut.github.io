# Practical *nix for Web Developers: A blog series

Working at a [dev school](http://makersquare.com), I'm ceaselessly amazed by two things:

1. How quickly students pick up programming fundamentals in this setting compared to the endless frustrations I encountered when teaching myself how to code.

and

2. How correspondingly hard it is for students to wrap their head around working with the terminal in OSX or in their particular flavor of Linux.

For me, it was always the opposite. I hid from programming for years, afraid I would be a Dilbert in a 'cube, feeling inferior to all my Math whiz colleagues.

Yet, Linux was my favorite toy as a teenager. I grew up playing with DOS, and "real nerds" always seemed to be playing around in command-line interfaces rather than clicking around Windows. Linux appealed to me as someone who wanted to "really use" a computer.

When I went off to college, I studied foreign languages (Japanese in particular) and thought my computer nerd days were behind me. Over time, I slowly began to find my mind wandering back to computers, then to tinkering more with Linux in particular. After the 2008 recession hit in my 3rd year of university, I realized I needed to be more serious about my career, and started to seriously consider going into Linux system administration. One night, after writing one-too-many bash scripts, I taught myself enough Python to rewrite one of my scripts and started wondering if I hadn't given that whole coding thing a fair shake. That was the catalyst for the past few years of my life as I've become immersed in the world of software development, and has single-handedly been the biggest turning point in my adult life.

Looking back though, I wonder how much my background tinkering with Linux influenced how I learned code. I found learning how to code really difficult, I had little direction and didn't really know anyone else who coded. But, I never once had any problem getting my environment setup or setting up a virtual private server to host my applications to share with friends and family. Watching my friends try to learn how to code only to eventually abandon the endeavor, seeing students come in to the first day of each new class who are in a state of constant conflict with their terminal, they've all made me realize that my experience was *not* normal. Many coding newcomers waste a lot of their time poking around the terminal, hoping some snippet they copy from a Stack Overflow answer might solve their problem.

This blog series is going to be my attempt to give a coding newcomer the experience necessary to conquer coding without the terminal being the limiting factor. This is going to be a multi-part series, with one new post per week released on Fridays.

The first post in this series will be on **Files in *nix** and will be released **Friday, June 27th**.

I will also probably release an additional post about the history of *nix and its influence on modern-day computing as an auxiliary post for people who care about that kind of thing (I certainly do!).
